# Movie Battle

This project originally started out as a code-along of the React Fundamentals online course as offered by Tyler McGinnis. However, after completing that course, I wanted to build on my understanding, so I have began playing around with the code to create my own application that allows users to pit one movie against another in a battle of IMDB ratings.
